class LinkNeighborLoader(LinkLoader):
  r"""A link-based data loader derived as an extension of the node-based
  :class:`torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader`.
  This loader allows for mini-batch training of GNNs on large-scale graphs
  where full-batch training is not feasible.

  More specifically, this loader first selects a sample of edges from the
  set of input edges :obj:`edge_label_index` (which may or not be edges in
  the original graph) and then constructs a subgraph from all the nodes
  present in this list by sampling :obj:`num_neighbors` neighbors in each
  iteration.

    Args:
      data (Dataset): The `graphlearn_torch.data.Dataset` object.
      num_neighbors (List[int] or Dict[Tuple[str, str, str], List[int]]): The
        number of neighbors to sample for each node in each iteration.
        In heterogeneous graphs, may also take in a dictionary denoting
        the amount of neighbors to sample for each individual edge type.
        If an entry is set to :obj:`-1`, all neighbors will be included.
      neighbor_sampler (graphlearn_torch.sampler.BaseSampler, optional):
        The sampler implementation to be used with this loader.
        Needs to implement
        :meth:`~graphlearn_torch.sampler.BaseSampler.sample_from_edges`.
        The sampler implementation must be compatible with the input
        :obj:`data` object.
      edge_label_index (Tensor or EdgeType or Tuple[EdgeType, Tensor]):
        The edge indices, holding source and destination nodes to start
        sampling from.
        If set to :obj:`None`, all edges will be considered.
        In heterogeneous graphs, needs to be passed as a tuple that holds
        the edge type and corresponding edge indices.
        (default: :obj:`None`)
      edge_label (Tensor, optional): The labels of edge indices from which to
        start sampling from. Must be the same length as
        the :obj:`edge_label_index`. (default: :obj:`None`)
      neg_sampling (NegativeSampling, optional): The negative sampling
        configuration.
        For negative sampling mode :obj:`"binary"`, samples can be accessed
        via the attributes :obj:`edge_label_index` and :obj:`edge_label` in
        the respective edge type of the returned mini-batch.
        In case :obj:`edge_label` does not exist, it will be automatically
        created and represents a binary classification task (:obj:`0` =
        negative edge, :obj:`1` = positive edge).
        In case :obj:`edge_label` does exist, it has to be a categorical
        label from :obj:`0` to :obj:`num_classes - 1`.
        After negative sampling, label :obj:`0` represents negative edges,
        and labels :obj:`1` to :obj:`num_classes` represent the labels of
        positive edges.
        Note that returned labels are of type :obj:`torch.float` for binary
        classification (to facilitate the ease-of-use of
        :meth:`F.binary_cross_entropy`) and of type
        :obj:`torch.long` for multi-class classification (to facilitate the
        ease-of-use of :meth:`F.cross_entropy`).
        For negative sampling mode :obj:`"triplet"`, samples can be
        accessed via the attributes :obj:`src_index`, :obj:`dst_pos_index`
        and :obj:`dst_neg_index` in the respective node types of the
        returned mini-batch.
        :obj:`edge_label` needs to be :obj:`None` for :obj:`"triplet"`
        negative sampling mode.
        If set to :obj:`None`, no negative sampling strategy is applied.
        (default: :obj:`None`)
      batch_size (int): How many samples per batch to load (default: ``1``).
      shuffle (bool): Set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled at every
        epoch (default: ``False``).
      drop_last (bool): Set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch, if
        the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
        the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last
        batch will be smaller. (default: ``False``).
      batch_size (int): How many samples per batch to load (default: ``1``).
      shuffle (bool): Set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled at every
        epoch (default: ``False``).
      drop_last (bool): Set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch, if
        the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
        the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last
        batch will be smaller. (default: ``False``).
      with_edge (bool): Set to ``True`` to sample with edge ids and also include
        them in the sampled results. (default: ``False``).
      strategy: (str): Set sampling strategy for the default neighbor sampler
        provided by graphlearn-torch. (default: ``"random"``).
      **kwargs (optional): Additional arguments of
        :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, such as :obj:`batch_size`,
        :obj:`shuffle`, :obj:`drop_last` or :obj:`num_workers`.
