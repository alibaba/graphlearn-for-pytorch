class NeighborLoader(NodeLoader):
  r"""A data loader that performs node neighbor sampling for mini-batch training
  of GNNs on large-scale graphs.

  Args:
    data (Dataset): The `graphlearn_torch.data.Dataset` object.
    num_neighbors (List[int] or Dict[Tuple[str, str, str], List[int]]): The
      number of neighbors to sample for each node in each iteration.
      In heterogeneous graphs, may also take in a dictionary denoting
      the amount of neighbors to sample for each individual edge type.
      If an entry is set to :obj:`-1`, all neighbors will be included.
    input_nodes (torch.Tensor or str or Tuple[str, torch.Tensor]): The
      indices of nodes for which neighbors are sampled to create
      mini-batches.
      Needs to be either given as a :obj:`torch.LongTensor` or
      :obj:`torch.BoolTensor`.
      In heterogeneous graphs, needs to be passed as a tuple that holds
      the node type and node indices.
    batch_size (int): How many samples per batch to load (default: ``1``).
    shuffle (bool): Set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled at every
      epoch (default: ``False``).
    drop_last (bool): Set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch, if
      the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
      the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last
      batch will be smaller. (default: ``False``).
    with_edge (bool): Set to ``True`` to sample with edge ids and also include
      them in the sampled results. (default: ``False``).
    strategy: (str): Set sampling strategy for the default neighbor sampler
      provided by graphlearn-torch. (default: ``"random"``).
    as_pyg_v1 (bool): Set to ``True`` to return result as the NeighborSampler
      in PyG v1. (default: ``False``).
